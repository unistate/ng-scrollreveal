In particular for ScrollReveal JS, run:\nnpm install --save scrollrevealTo avoid compilation warnings during development, you can also install the typings for ScrollReveal JS :\nnpm install --save-dev (types/scrollreveal\nAngular-CLI\n\nNote: If you are using angular-cli to build your app, make sure that scrollreveal is properly listed as a global library, by editing your angular-cli.json as such:\n      \"scripts\": [\n        \"../node_modules/scrollreveal/dist/scrollreveal.js\"\n      ],\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for ng-scrollreveal:\nmap: {\n  'ng-scrollreveal': 'node_modules/ng-scrollreveal/bundles/ng-scrollreveal.min.js',\n}In your systemjs config file, meta needs to tell the System loader how to load scrollreveal:\n    meta: {\n    './node_modules/scrollreveal/dist/scrollreveal.min.js': {\n            format: 'amd'\n        }\n    }In your index.html file, add script tag to load  scrollreveal globally:\n    \n    \n    \n    \n\nNow install ng-scrollreveal via:\nnpm install --save ng-scrollrevealOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport {NgsRevealModule} from 'ng-scrollreveal';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice NgsRevealModule.forRoot()):\nimport {NgsRevealModule} from 'ng-scrollreveal';\n\n(NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgsRevealModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import NgsRevealModule:\nimport {NgsRevealModule} from 'ng-scrollreveal';\n\n(NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgsRevealModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}Usage\nThe library is composed of two main directives: ngsReveal and ngsRevealSet.\nngsReveal Directive\n\nUse this directive to reveal/hide a single DOM element upon scroll.\nBasic Usage:\n    ..With Custom Options:\nYou can also pass in a custom configuration object to the directive.\n    ..This will override the default configuration used when revealing this particular element.\nWhen no configuration is passed in, the directive uses the default configuration defined at component or at application level.\nConfiguration options are the same as ScrollReveal JS configuration object. \nngsRevealSet Directive\n\nUse this directive to reveal/hide a set of DOM elements upon scroll.\n[ngsSelector] attribute is required, and defines which child items must be revealed/hidden on scroll.\n\nNote: The value is a list of CSS selectors (comma-separated).\n\nBasic Usage:\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    With Custom Options:\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    Configuration options are the same as ScrollReveal JS configuration object. \nSequentially animated items:\nChild items inside the parent set can be sequentially animated, by adding the [ngsRevealInterval] attribute.\n\nNote: The interval is the time until the next element in the sequence begins its reveal, which is separate from the time until the elementâ€™s animation completes. In this example, the sequence interval is 50 milliseconds.\n\n    \n        Item 1\n        Item 2\n        Item 3\n        Item 4\n        Item 5 (will not be animated)\n    Global Configuration\n\nYou can inject the config service, typically in your root component, and customize the values of its properties in order to provide default values for all the ng-reveal directives used in the application.\nimport {Component} from '(angular/core';\nimport {NgsRevealConfig} from 'ng-scrollreveal';\n\n(Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.scss'],\n  providers: [NgbTabsetConfig] // add NgsRevealConfig to the component providers\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  constructor(config: NgsRevealConfig) {\n    // customize default values of ng-scrollreveal directives used by this component tree\n    config.duration = 5000;\n    config.easing = 'cubic-bezier(0.645, 0.045, 0.355, 1)';\n\n    //other options here\n  }\n}Credits\nng-scrollreveal is built upon ScrollReveal JS by Julian Lloyd.
